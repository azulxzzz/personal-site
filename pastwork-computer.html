                              <p>In 2016, I decided to build my first computer after hearing about some of my friends doing it. I had just started high school, and I wanted to have a machine that was powerful enough to handle all of the gaming I wanted to do. Plus, I had always been interested in computers and how they worked, so building my own seemed like a fun challenge. I did a ton of research online and finally ordered the parts. It took me a few hours to put everything together, and I had to troubleshoot some errors, but when I fired up my new machine for the first time, it was a great feeling. It ran perfectly and was exactly what I had wanted. I was proud of myself for accomplishing something that seemed so daunting at first. Building my own computer was a great experience, and I'm glad I did it.</p>

                              <p>I have no doubt that my experience back in high school is a relatable one for many people. Most people in IT have built their own computer at some point or at least know how to put one together. It was a special feeling for me when I did it for the first time because it almost felt like I was a part of this community. The excitement from building a PC was what inspired me to go further and do things like tinker with a Raspberry Pi or learn Linux. Although the best part of the whole experience was learning everything. It was a great feeling to walk up to a computer that someone said wasn't working and have the knowledge to be able to fix it. As time went on, this feeling never went away and I've been committed to learning all that I can when it comes to computers and networks.</p>
